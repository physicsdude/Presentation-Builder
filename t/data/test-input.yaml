          - Who is this guy anyway?
          - No, I'm not one of the authors of Moose, the coolest kid on the block, or one of the world's foremost experts on OO
          - I'm a retired particle physicist, who somehow learned Perl by mistake in graduate school

          - I just like Moose and I wanted to brush up on it, so I wrote a module to write this talk with
          - This Moose talk writes itself <b>WITH</b> Moose --------->>
          - <b>Disclaimer</b> Don't take anything you see here for the best way to do it ... it's just the way I did it
          - Moose is very meta too

          - Moose is a Meta-Object system
          - <a target='_blank' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=5oXCm4N3J_M#t=10s'>Basically, it like uses objects to like do stuff with objects</a>

          - If you really want to know how Moose REALLY works, ask this guy
          - He was a JavaScript developer until 2002

          - Or ask this guy, he's hella smart --------->
          - MooseX::Declare is everything you hoped Moose would be, and more

          - It sweeps SO much more under the rug, it's CRAZY (see next slide please)
          - Seriously though, it means you can write beautiful code
          - But still use all of things you love about Perl (The CPAN, one liners, magical variables, map, grep, sort, oh my!)
          - (I'm talking about this vs. giving up and using Ruby or Python or what not!)

          - All of the examples in this talk are MooseX::Declare, because I like it a lot
          - (But honestly they'd only look a bit messier without it)

          - This talk uses the S5 presentation system 
          - To display HTML generated with module I wrote for this talk 
          - Presentation::Builder
          - <a href='https://github.com/physicsdude/Presentation-Builder'>https://github.com/physicsdude/Presentation-Builder</a>
          - Downsides of any presentation system for code talks include <b>broken code samples</b>, <b>dealing with stupid markup you don't understand and/or don't want to deal with</b>, <b>having to show example code instead of real code</b>, <b>adding images can be a huge pain</b>, etc.

          - "Get your favorite S5 template <div style='font-size: 0.7em'>You can do whatever you want in the header of the template and any content in the 'presentation' div will be overwritten</div>"
          - Make a YAML config file file
          - "If you want to use snippets, mark up your code with <br>#&lt;snip some name&gt;<br>...<br>#&lt;/snip&gt;"
          - Add some meta info and your slides to the config file
          - Ship IT!

          - Yes, this example was pulled from the code used to generate the text you're reading right now, and syntax highlighted for HTML using Text::VimColor
          - Oh yeah, you have to add the contents of less.css to your template's css or something if you want that to work (room for improvement here)
