Presentation-Builder
====================

Moose-Based Module to Write Talks That I Used to Write a Talk About Moose for the Phoenix Perl Mongers
To view the talk, grab the code (git pull or zip file), and open this file in your browser  Presentation-Builder/t/data/index.html

Check out a recording of the talk on YouTube.

Warning: it's one hour, four minutes long.  I was told to take my time :)

I also based another talk about Perl debugging at least partly on this module, see 
Presentation-Builder/t/data/nov14.html
